Simple code written for fun and later on used in an article in the ACCU's
CVu magazine about static libraries and GNU Make.

Other utility functions to consider implementing:
chomp - delete last char in string if it is a \n
chop  - delete last char in string regardless

Consider other functions written in the past.
